## Part 1:
Using an HTTP GET method, retrieve information from Wikipedia using a given topic. Query https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=parse&section=0&prop=text&format=json&page=[topic] to get the topic Wikipedia article.
Print the total number of times that the string [topic] appears in the article's text field. Expose your backend code as an API.
## Part 2:
Write a frontend that calls the API that you're exposing. The frontend can be very simple - just an input field and some way to submit and display the results. Feel free to be creative.
For both parts, use any language or framework that youâ€™d like.
